Synopsis
------------------------------------------------

Group similar events together. This command provides a few clustering algorithms [1]_ using Scikit-Learn [2]_, using language modelling algorithms from Gensim [3]_.


Syntax
````````````````````````````````````````````````

:: 

  nlcluster [algo=mean_shift | affinity_propagation | dbscan] [model=lsi | tfidf] <field-list>


Arguments
````````````````````````````````````````````````

field-list
  **Syntax**: ``<string>, ...``

  **Default**: ``_raw``

  **Description**: 

algo
  **Syntax**: ``mean_shift | affinity_propagation | dbscan`` 

  **Default**: ``mean_shift``

  **Description**: The algorithm to use for clustering depending on your use case.  The default Mean Shift algorithm works well for different types of log data [4]_ [5]_. Mean Shift aims to discover blobs in a smooth density of samples and is guaranteed to converge. Also available are Affinity Propagation [6]_ and DBSCAN [7]_ [8]_. Affinity Propagation determines clusters by propogating messages between samples until convergence; this results in a high complexity algorithm that works better with small to medium sized datasets. DBSCAN can handle unevenly sized clusters within a large sample set; however, it is nondeterministic and empirically we have not found it to cluster log data as well as Mean Shift.


model
  **Syntax**: ``lsi | tfidf``

  **Default**: ``lsi``

  **Description**: The semantic model to use for measuring similarity between events. This field only applies when using string fields, where the text of the fields is converted to a vector. The default model is Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [9]_. Alternatively, you can use the TF-IDF model [10]_. Using LSI, cosine similarity tends to be more accurate than TF-IDF models, although the TF-IDF model may perform faster and use less memory. LSI also provides an "online training" facility (ability to continuously train a pre-existing model), that while this implementation does not currently take advantage may be able to do so in the future.


Description
------------------------------------------------

Use the ``nlcluster`` command to find common or rare events/field values within a window of data.  For example, you can use this command to group similar log events and find common errors in log output.  You can sort the output by the ``cluster_size`` field in order to find the most common lines or rare (anomalous) lines. 

The ``nlcluster`` command uses a semantic model to create similarity comparisons for string data, in the form of vectors, which can be passed to a clustering algorithm. If using numeric data, the vector will be formed from each of the numeric field values specified in ``<field-list>``.

 
Examples
------------------------------------------------


**Example 1**: Using honeypot data from SecRepo [11]_, find the most common attack payloads. You can download the json dataset `here <http://www.secrepo.com/honeypot/honeypot.json.zip>`_::

  index=sample source="*honeypot.json*" | nlcluster payload | sort -cluster_size

Here's a snapshot of the results:

If we expand the first event, you can see the ``cluster_size`` and ``cluster_label`` fields:

**Example 2**: Cluster common events in SSH ``auth.log`` entries, and sort by ``cluster_size`` to find potential outliers::
  
  index=os source="*auth.log*" earliest=-1h "sshd" | nlcluster model=tfidf | sort cluster_size

Here's a snapshot of the results:
